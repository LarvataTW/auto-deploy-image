    Detected a major version difference between the the chart that is currently deploying (#{current_chart.to_s}), and the previously deployed chart (#{previous_chart.to_s}).

    Please follow the appropriate instructions:

    - To proceed with the new chart version, follow the manual upgrade guide
      https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/upgrading_chart.html#upgrade-guide and redeploy.

    - To continue using the previously deployed chart, see the following instructions:
      https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/upgrading_chart.html#keep-using-a-specific-version-of-chart and redeploy.
